## Introduction :
The Purpose of the project is to prdict the price of the Diamond Based on various features like Carat , Depth , Table , Color etc. Since the price is continuos value, hence we will use Regression to solve this. We will use Supervised Machine Learning Teachnique like Linear Regression , Lasso Regression etc. First we will collect the dataset from kaggle and then will do preprocessing. That is Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) , Feature Engineering that is Feature selection and Feature Scaling and Imputation in case of missing values. After Preprocessing (Data Cleaning) we will use the cleaned data for the model training and then after model evaluation we will select best out of these.

## About Data Set
* **price** : price in US dollars ( $326 - $18,823 ) 

 * **carat** : weight of the diamond ( 0.2 - 5.01 )

 * **cut** : quality of the cut ( Fair , Good , Very Good , Premium , Ideal )

 * **color** : diamond colour, from J ( worst ) to D ( best )

 * **clarity** : a measurement of how clear the diamond is ( I1 (worst) ,SI2 ,SI1 ,VS2 ,VS1 ,VVS2 ,VVS1 ,IF (best))

 * **x** : length in mm ( 0 - 10.74 )

 * **y** : width in mm ( 0 - 58.9 )

 * **z** : depth in mm ( 0 - 31.8 )

 * **depth** : total depth percentage = z / mean( x, y ) = 2 * z / ( x + y ) --> ( 43 - 79 )

 * **table** : width of top of diamond relative to widest point ( 43 - 95 )
